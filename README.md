## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use this account for work so the vast majority of my contributions are on private repositories and are subject to to intellectual property rights and non-disclosure agreements.

Anything public here are hobby projects or prototypes I did as a student and shouldn't be assumed to be production ready.
